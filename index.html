                    My name is Caroline Rink. I was born in Atlanta in 1995. I grew up in Marietta, GA and went school at Pope High School. I attended the University of West Georgia for my undergraduate and I graduated in December of 2017 with a BA in History.

                    I enjoy traveling and I participated in two study abroad programs through my University. I went to Berlin, Germany in the summer of 2015 and Waterford, Ireland in the summer of 2017. I will also be heading to Sweden, Denmark, and Holland this coming summer.

                    When I am not traveling, I love to draw and paint. I plan to take a pottery class in the near future, too. I like to explore many different mediums when it comes to art; although, I don't consider myself an artist.

                    I am also passionate about animals. I have two cats, Stella and Goose, and I plan volunteer at the Atlanta Humane Society this summer.
